### ðŸš€Section-1 (Linux)ðŸš€

#### Question-1: Explain file system architecture of Linux OS ?
**Ans:** The file system architecture of a Linux operating system is a hierarchical structure that organizes and manages files, directories, and other data on storage devices such as hard drives and SSDs. The architecture is based on the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which defines the layout and naming conventions for different directories in the system. Below is an explanation of the key components of the file system architecture in Linux:

* **Root (/):** The root directory is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy, denoted by a forward slash (/). All other directories and files are located beneath the root directory. The root directory is essential for the system's functioning, and it contains directories like /bin, /etc, /home, /usr, and others.

* **/bin:** This directory contains essential binary executables that are required for basic system operations. These binaries are essential for system maintenance and booting, and they are available to all users.

* **/boot:** The /boot directory contains files related to the boot process, including the Linux kernel, initial ramdisk (initrd), boot configuration files, and bootloader (e.g., GRUB).

* **/dev:** The /dev directory contains device files that represent physical and virtual devices on the system. These files allow users and applications to interact with hardware devices.

* **/etc:** This directory contains system-wide configuration files. Important configuration files for various applications, services, and system settings are stored here.

* **/home:** Each user on the system typically has their own subdirectory under /home, where they can store their personal files and settings. For example, the user "john" might have their home directory at /home/john.

* **/lib and /lib64:** These directories contain shared libraries (also known as dynamic link libraries) that are required by various programs on the system.

* **/media and /mnt:** These directories are used to temporarily mount removable media devices (e.g., USB drives) and other file systems manually.

* **/opt:** The /opt directory is used for installing optional software packages. It is typically used by software that is not part of the core system distribution.

* **/proc:** The /proc directory is a virtual file system that provides information about processes and system status. It contains dynamic kernel data that can be accessed as regular files.

* **/root:** This is the home directory for the root user, the administrative user with full privileges on the system.

* **/sbin:** Similar to /bin, the /sbin directory contains essential system binaries, but these are meant for system administrators and require elevated privileges.

* **/tmp:** The /tmp directory is used to store temporary files that may be required by various processes. The contents of this directory are usually cleared on system boot.

* **/usr:** The /usr directory contains user-related files and programs that are not essential for the system's basic operation. It includes user binaries, libraries, documentation, and more.

* **/var:** This directory contains variable data that can change frequently during system operation. It includes log files, spool files (e.g., for printing and mail), temporary files, and more.

```
#### Question-5: How to replace word "2022" with "2023" into all file (including sub folders) using shell scripting ?
Ans: using sed command this can be acieved.
```
sed -i "s/2022/2023/g" *.*
# Note: 2022 is old value and 2023 is new value (which we want to replace with)
```
```
sed -i "s/Sunday/Monday/g" *.*
Note: Sunday is old value and Monday is new value (which we want to replace with)
```
#### Question-6: How to remove files and its directory ?
Ans:
```
rm -rf <dir-path>
```
#### Question-7: What is `grep` command, and how to use it ?
Ans: `grep` stands for Global Regular Expression Print, basically we use `grep` command to perform search operation in Linux.
Example: 
```
# Below is the command to search those lines which contains ERROR.
grep 'ERROR' file1.txt
```
#### Question-8: What is `find` command, and how to use it ?
Ans: `find` command also used to perform search operation in linux.
Example:
```
find <expression> <path>
find *.log /var/log
find *.txt .
```

#### Question-9: What is use of `pipe` command, and how to use it ?
Ans: The pipe command, often represented by the vertical bar symbol |, is a powerful feature in command-line interfaces and shell scripting. It allows you to take the output of one command and use it as the input to another command. This feature enables you to chain commands together, creating powerful and flexible data processing pipelines.

The basic syntax of using the pipe command is:
```
command1 | command2
cat file1.txt | sort | head -4
```
```
cat file1.txt | grep "Apple"
```

#### Question-10: What is the difference between `inode` and `ProcessID` ?
**Ans:** In Linux, an `inode` is a data structure that stores metadata about a file, such as ownership, permissions, and disk block locations. A process ID (PID) is a unique identifier assigned to each running process. 
Inodes represent files on the filesystem, while PIDs identify active processes in the operating system.

#### Question-11: How to check process-id in Linux ?
**Ans:** using `top` and `ps -ef` command.
```
top

ps -ef | grep nginx    # it will only show the nginx process
```
#### Question-12: What is swap space in linux ?
**Ans:** Swap space in Linux is a designated area on the hard drive used as virtual memory extension when physical RAM is insufficient. It allows the OS to move inactive data from RAM, freeing up memory for active processes.

#### Question-13: What is the command to check which service is running on which port ?
**Ans:** 
```
# To check all running applications
netstat -ano

# To check which service is running on 8080 port

#### Question-3: What is difference between `git fetch` and `git pull` ?
**Ans:** Git Fetch is the command that tells the local repository that there are changes available in the remote repository without bringing the changes into the local repository. Git Pull on the other hand brings the copy of the remote directory changes into the local repository

#### Question-4: What is `git stash` command ?
**Ans:** The git stash command takes your uncommitted changes (both staged and unstaged), saves them away for later use, and then reverts them from your working copy.

#### Question-5: What is `git rebase` command and when we use it ?
**Ans:** Rebasing is the process of moving or combining a sequence of commits to a new base commit. Rebasing is most useful and easily visualized in the context of a feature branching workflow.

#### Question-6: What is difference `git fork` and `git clone` ? 
**Ans:** A fork creates a completely independent copy of Git repository. In contrast to a fork, a Git clone creates a linked copy that will continue to synchronize with the target repository.

#### Question-7: What is `git revert` command ? 
**Ans:** The git revert command is a forward-moving undo operation that offers a safe method of undoing changes. Instead of deleting or orphaning commits in the commit history, a revert will create a new commit that inverses the changes specified.

#### Question-7: What is the command to delete remote branch ? 
**Ans:** 
```
git push origin -d <branch-name>
#or
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
```
